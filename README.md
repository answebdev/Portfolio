# Portfolio

I am a front-end web developer based in San Diego, California, and I enjoy creating clean and dynamic web applications. Although I have a diverse set of skills involving both front-end and back-end technologies, my main passion is front-end development. I love focusing on what the user sees and love learning about new technologies that I can implement for a great user experience. As a user-focused developer, I stand for quality and focus on details in order to produce and develop great web applications and user-friendly experiences.
